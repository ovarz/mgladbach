			<p><b>Borussia M'Gladbach Academy Indonesia has partnered with German Bundesliga club Borussia Mönchengladbach, that is internationally recognized for its outstanding youth development programs.</b></p>
			<p>So you can be confident that we follow the most modern  training practices. Borussia coaching employs age-specific training programs that focus on skill development, motor coordination and the fundamentals of team play.</p>
			<p>Borussia players do not stand in a queue to await their turn every few minutes. The small games approach (1v1,2v2,4v4) is particularly crucial and effective for the younger age groups (4 - 9), and ensures maximum engagement and contact with the ball for every player. <b>Borussia training methods</b> encourage players to be creative thinkers and decision makers in a variety of game situations. There are no boring, monotonous, repetitive drills!</p>
			<p>Once young players are ready, we will provide them with match play experiences without pressure to win.</p>
			<p>We focus on the players' long term development, not short term results, and our parents are most supportive. We do not want to win at all cost but give our best effort and play as a team.</p>
